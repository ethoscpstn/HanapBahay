Drop PNG or JPG thumbnails here to replace the default document previews.

Expected filenames (match these exactly to override the inline placeholders):
  - gov-id-sample.png
  - barangay-permit-sample.png
  - dti-sec-sample.png
  - business-permit-sample.png
  - bir-permit-sample.png

Use landscape images around 160×100 px so they fit nicely beside the upload fields.

Clicking a sample thumbnail opens the full-size image. If you want higher resolution in the modal, simply place a larger PNG/JPG with the same filename – the thumbnail view scales it down, but the modal uses the original dimensions.
